I work as a volunteer in the **[Coursera's Global Translator Community](https://coursera.community/gtc-news-announcements-17/join-the-coursera-global-translator-community-45)**. I translate English courses in Coursera to Chinese (Simplified). 

I have contributed to the translation of following courses:

1. [Writing, Running, and Fixing Code in C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-running-fixing-code).
